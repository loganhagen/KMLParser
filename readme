KMLParser is a lightweight parser and editor for KML files, built as part of coursework for a sophomore-level software engineering course. It is built with a combination of C (back-end) and Python (front-end). 

Editable KML fields: Names of points; Colours and widths of styles.

Any KML file can be used, however they must adhere to certain contraints for the following types of elements:
- (1) <KML> element.
- Maximum (1) <Document> element.
- (0) or more <Placemark>, <Style>, and <StyleMap> elements.
Please see the provided test files for compatible KML files. 

Compilation: Enter `make parser` at root level to compile source files.
To run: Enter `python3 KMLParser.py` in bin after compilation. Ensure that any KML files intended for use are also in bin.
